Nakamura's citation of Lev Manovich saying "interactive media ask us to identify with someone elseâ€™s mental structure" can be interpreted by
the layout of the said interactive media. The team of creators who issues the media had to put their own perception of how the media should
operate, thus stemming down to the user's intepretations. The user navigates the media as it is instructed. 

An interactive media site such as instagram is much more than the designer's vision. The various users on instagram post photos/videos
with the intention that their followers will react a certain way. It is an equal stream of activity from the poster and the followers.
Usually the follower's comprehend the post a certain way, both with the message and their own intended meanings.
