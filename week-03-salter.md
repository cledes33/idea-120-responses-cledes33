## The Contemporary Tools for Gesamtkunstwerk
<p>There are many contemporary tools used to create art that could be considered Gesamtkunstwerk. 
In a simple sense, one could consider a mixed media collage a Gesamtkunstwerk. A work of art created on a wooden board displaying clippings of magazines glued 
with different strokes of paint is a combination of elements. A documentation of this work would solidify a contemporary tool, with photographing the collage.
Some more contemporary tools used to make a Gesamtkunstwerk could be a midi keyboard, an electric sticker maker, and a laptop to possibly animate characters. The 
possibilities of modern Gesamtkunstwerk are endless with our 21st century technology.</p>
