O'Neil describes the Weapons of Math Descrution (also known as WMD) into three different categories. She says that opacity, scale and damage are used
by mathmatical models to wreck havoc on everyday people. By opacity, behavioral data can be generally read as a mere system. These generated trackings
such as tailored ads and algorithms force the consumer to believe they fall in a specific social group. Simply, these are just patterns gathered
from computer data rather than an in depth look into one's tastes and personality. 

The scale in which a WMD works can vary. In today's society, we see apps like instagram and tik tok shift views and trends in a matter of seconds. 
Information is fed at millions of people (whether fact or fiction) rapidly and massively. The different age ranges targeted and the contents
of the popular algorithms are wide-spread to new users. 

Damages surely occur by negatively effecting the viewers. Differing notions about whats fair can underly accidentally amongst a math based program.
For example, a well-rounded student and exceed in homework assignments, participation within community and overall be a positive asset to one's
peer group. But failing a major exam like the SAT can deem them more "unworthy" of acceptance to a major univserity based on a score.
