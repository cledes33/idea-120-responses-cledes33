For my Twitch project, I plan on centering the game on a fictional character on named "Chizzo." their appearence is somewhat like a large
and spherical seahorse. The setting of Chizzos can be depicted as a life-like world that can be transcended into water as well.

I plan on introducing Sr. Chizzo, and various options one can participate with him in. Examples could be cooking, swimming, chippling
watching, or killing him. Along the string of options, I may also choose to include other characters if warrented in the non-linear
story selection.
