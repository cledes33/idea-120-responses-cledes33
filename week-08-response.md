The tools highlighted by O'Neil that advertising campagins use are vulnerabilities and issue targets. In my experiences that relate
to tailored ads for myself, I will see prevelent resolutions for problems I am addressing via social media or text message. For
example, if i'm explaining issues pertaining to my mental health to a friend I will later see a recruitment campaign ad for
young adults with depression. It feels invasive, yet humorous since it is spot on with my current endeavors. 

Chalabi Goes in depth on government issues surveys and those resuluts broadcasted to the nation. She states that a small represention data
group is not specifically referring to "you", but rather a broad average. Private data and surveys are accurate with the number pool, but
there are not enough representatives to make the results accurate. Government based surveys emit important information and can
misrepresent certain datas and their partcipants. Ads should not be direct and targeted because it's a way for companies to
reel in blind consumers without consent and postive inclination.
