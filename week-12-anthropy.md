In the "Rise of Videogame Zinesters" By Anna Anthropy, she explroes the topic of who dominates
the video game and coding industry. She reveals that white men who are college educated are the main
breadwinners of the video game and digital landscape. Herself as a trans-woman dabbles with the idea
that there should be many more people of color and those apart of the LGBTQ+ community being
represented in the coding and videogame creating landscape.

Anthropy explains that the majority of video games are men shooting men in the face, or women shooting men.
Another topic constantly seen in the virtual industry is women working as waitresses or not being
front casted as much as male characters/personas. 

The world can gain from a larger number of voices by exploring different game play exerpiences. Not every
story has to be violence related, or a man shooting. With different creative mind sets and demographics
allowed, there can be a much more interesting pool of games to select from.

Giving those who are marginalized a platform to distribute fresh gaming technqiues and options would
allow gamers to exerperience different thought patterns and intrigue. The tired old game cretors of similar
background does not allow room for growth. Fresh ideas from various different perspectives will give
reign to coding and video game culture.
