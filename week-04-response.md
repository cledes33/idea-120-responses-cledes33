For example, if there was a photograph of an animal crossing cross-breed flower guide (originally posted on Reddit)
translated into a different media (bias source such as Fox News)
This sort of image linguistically says the follower names such a Lillies, Roses, Cosmos, Mums, Winddlowers, Pansies, Hyacinths and Tulips
The pure image as a whole displays the followers in different charts, and the different color combinations possible
conceptually, the flower chart is used to be a cheat on how to attain all the variety of flowers on animal crossing
a bias news source could refrence this chart as a way to blame video game addiction on all of the cool flower options available.
