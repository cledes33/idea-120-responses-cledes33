Murray's predictions about internet television and inhabiting virtual enviromments is succesfully predicted. 
For example, as we know it we can connect our televsion to our wifi and stream youtube videos, spotify and various other apps.
The our access to Netflix and other streaming services via our computer and smartphone, we can watch shows and movies anywhere at anytime!
The availbility to connect to most platforms from any device rightly shows Murray's predicitions as our current reality.

Murray's predicitions compare to the hyper-realistic virtual envirnoment of 'The Mandalorian' by combining the elemnets of a green screen 
and the virtual set. This background combination relates closely to the notion of the internet television. The actors are able to accurately depict
where a landmark or object is in the background, along with editors being able to edit a scene's lighting and cinematography with the greenscreen layer. 
Viewers can enjoy a fully emersive experience with the technologies of virtual sets and greenscreens correlating with actor's performances.
To add on, viewers of internet television can easily access what they need from any of their devices seamlessly.
