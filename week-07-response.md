The problems laid out by Bridle state that children's youtube is filled with frightening videos. These videos are mainily produced by bots. 
They feature popular cartoon characters and story lines, which children are drawn to. They often depict these characters in disturbing
ways. The fact that these channels who post these videos are youtube verrified is a red flag in the verification stand point.

Bridle elaborates and thinks what needs to be done is to monitor childnen's viewing habits and not to simply trust a verrified sign.
With children aimelessly given the tools to scroll through the internet, it is quite uncertain what they will stumble upon. The combination 
of bots, algorithms and creators showcasing these videos to children should be reviewed amongst youtube and guardians.
